Abstract
We will discuss methods of Optimal Transportation Theory and its
relations to problems in quantum mechanics. This essentially means
that the cost function is some Hamiltonian H(q,p) on phase space
(symplectic manifold), and the marginal measures that have to be
transported are linked by a (implicit) transformation group.


BTW
There is a great book about OPT :)
