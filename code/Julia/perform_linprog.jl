function perform_linprog(A,b,c,maxit=-1,tol=1e-10)
    """
        LINPROG  This code uses the revised simplex method to solve the linear
               programming problem: Minimize the cost c'x subject to
               equations Ax=b and nonnegativity x >=0:

                        f =  Min { c'x; Ax = b, x >= 0 },

               You must define an m by n matrix A , a column vector b with
               m components, and a column vector c with n components.

               The output vector x gives the minimum cost, which is the output f.

                        [x,f,itn] = linprog(A,b,c,k,maxit,tol)

               At most "maxit" iterations (default 10*length(b)) are applied
               and the actual number of iterations is returned in "itn".

               If the optimal solution is unbounded or the constraints are
               inconsistent then a diagnostic is displayed.
               Bland's rule is used to resolve degeneracies.  In exact
               arithmetic cycling is not possible.  But in real life!!!
               If x has more than 20 components it is returned in the
               sparse format. Note that if A has many zeros it is worth
               passing it to linprog in sparse format.

               Although written for teaching purposes this routine has
               successfully solved some problems with size(A) = [50,100000]!
